                        Two things in particular are very important to me: Eating the foods I love and
                        staying lean.
                        If I feel like eating donuts, I eat donuts. When I want a beer, a margarita or a
                        sake bomb, I imbibe. If I'm at a restaurant, I'll get a steak and some delicious
                        sides, then finish it off with dessert. In other words, I eat what I want, when I
                        want it. (Within reason, of course.)
